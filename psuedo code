no reposts?
    might be better
might be worth keeping reacts anonymous
    or pay more, new authorization for seeing list of which users reacted what to what
        would require seperate .js files for likes, confuses, hates, in relation to: users, tracks, or playlists\



Navi:

    {/*//nav is at top of all pages below header (in app.js), imported into app.js
            //except login for unregistered users

    //nav menus links too
        //home
            //landing page after login
        //this user's page
            //{"username"}, on hover expands subnav, if clicked, links to this user page with uploads, following/followers and reacts
                //tracks
                    //^user subsubnav "tracks", expand on hover

                    //favorites
                    //hates
                    //confuses
                //following
                //followers
        
                //input field for search, search.js rendered for search results


        //perhap new subnav expands on hover to reveal these buttons /link below
            //logout
                //logout pops up  as a modal "are you sure?", 
                //not a new page or speerate .js component
            //audio tornado switch
                //also not a new page
        
    //don't show the nav menu link / button to the current page being displayed below nav,
        // so if on home, don't show home in nav menu, 
                // except logout, which is not a new page but modal redirecting to unregistered login
                //"audio tornado" is exempt of this, it's a button, on/off switch, not a seperate page, enables animate on hover psuedo-class in bootstrap on all the other pages.

    // maybe side nav with transparencies ?
    make nav auto load for unauthenticated users, perhap links to see public home feed of top users /uploads, unable to react or follow until authenticated
